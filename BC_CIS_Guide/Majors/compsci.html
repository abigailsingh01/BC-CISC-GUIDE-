    <h1> Whose should pursue a Computer Science Degree? </h1>
    <p>Anyone who has a general interest in computers and programming. It is best for students who want to work as a programmer or systems analyst. This major will prepare you for all non-specialized fields of computing. It is especially suggested for students who want to go to graduate school to pursue Masters in Computer Science.
    </p>

    <h1> Helpful tips </h1>

    <p>Students must complete General Pathway Requirements (30 credits) along with the Computer Science major courses to complete their Bachelors of Science Degree in Computer Science. </p>
    <p>

    <p>To enroll in a CIS course, a student must have passed all prerequisite courses in the CIS department with a grade of C or higher. </p>

    <p>To enroll in a Math course, a student must have passed all Math prerequisite courses with a D- or better. </p>
