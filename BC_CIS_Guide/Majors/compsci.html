    <h1> Whose should pursue a Computer Science Degree? </h1>
    <p>Anyone who has a general interest in computers and programming. It is best for students who want to work as a programmer or systems analyst. This major will prepare you for all non-specialized fields of computing. It is especially suggested for students who want to go to graduate school to pursue Masters in Computer Science.
    </p>
